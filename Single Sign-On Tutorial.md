# Building a Single Sign-On (SSO) App in React Native with Expo

## Introduction
- Brief explanation of Single Sign-On (SSO) and its benefits
- Overview of the tutorial's goal and technologies used (React Native, Expo)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Expo CLI installed (npm install -g expo-cli)
- Basic knowledge of React Native and JavaScript

## Step 1: Set Up a New React Native Project with Expo
bash
Copy code
expo init MySSOApp
cd MySSOApp

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install necessary libraries for authentication and navigation.
bash
Copy code
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated

## Step 3: Set Up React Navigation
Configure basic navigation structure using react-navigation.
Create screens for Login, Home, and Profile.

## Step 4: Implement OAuth2 for Single Sign-On
Choose an OAuth2 provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Create an application on the chosen provider's developer console.
Obtain client ID and client secret.
Install necessary OAuth2 libraries.
bash
Copy code
npm install expo-auth-session
Implement OAuth2 authentication in the Login screen.

## Step 5: Store User Authentication State
Use React Context to manage authentication state.
Create a context for authentication.
Update the context based on the authentication status.

## Step 6: Protect Routes with Authentication
Implement a higher-order component or custom hook to protect routes.
Redirect users to the Login screen if not authenticated.

## Step 7: Display User Information
Fetch and display user information on the Profile screen after authentication.

## Step 8: Handle Logout
Implement a logout mechanism to clear authentication state.
Redirect users to the Login screen after logout.

## Step 9: Testing
Test the SSO functionality on various devices and platforms.
